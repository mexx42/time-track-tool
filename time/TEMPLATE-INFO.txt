Name: tttech
Description: This is a specialised tracker that is used here at tttech
             to not only track bugs and change requests, but furthermore
             alos do release planning and controlling in a convienient
             matter. Additionally, the Time-Tracking and absence/vacation
             information for the users is also done with this tracker.
             The tracker consists of a total of XXX classes and has several
             differnet state machines implemented for the different classes.
             I dont think this will be usable for anyone outside tttech, but
             it's a nice example to show you the flexibility of roundup.
Intended-For: Experienced Project Planners - maybe ;)
