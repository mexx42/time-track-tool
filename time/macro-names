To check:
=========

- html/page.html
- html/home.html
+ html/style.css   - use ttt version (only additions)
- html/file.item.html
+ html/_generic.collision.html -- identical
- html/_generic.help.html
+ html/_generic.history.html -- use ttt version and translate History to Verlauf
- html/_generic.index.html
  - Additional macros factored from ttt_issue in ttt version
  - export csv in ttt version
  - more parameters in ttt version
  - more exceptions in ttt version (messages, files): but *can* display
    messages and files with factored macros from ttt_issue
  - adr_type_cat.lookup stuff in abo
  - special hack for filter for adr_type attribute
  -> maybe create own template for classes that have adr_type attribute??
+ html/_generic.property_help.html -- ttt version for newer help version
- html/query.edit.html -- much work?
- html/query.item.html -- only in abo -- minimal version
- html/user.index.html
- html/user.item.html
+ html/user.register -- remove from abo
+ html/Makefile -- identical
- extensions/extproperty.py
  - use the newer ttt thing
  - check what that means for templates (!)
  -> search for all occurences of ExtProperty
- extensions/help.py
  - Merge after having both in alphabetical order (user.address in abo
    is in wrong order for example)
  - combined_name uses '++' instead of '.' in ttt
    -> needs to be reflected in help-text
  - merge special cases in help_properties (letter/daily_record etc)
  - generally ttt is newer
- extensions/interfaces
  - remove ttt specific stuff (user_dynamic, common imports)
  - hmm maybe rename one of those: don't seem to have much in common
- extensions/ExportCSVNamesAction.py
- locale (!)
  -> merge
  -> check against merged templates that everything is in german that
     has to be
- detectors: user (!) only in ttt
  -> make checks specific to existing attributes of user
  -> maybe even don't register checks if attributes aren't there.
  -> much work should have been done for it tracker

+ Also check migration to new roundup for abo
+ Check some permission things in ttt that are solved in abo

page.html
=========

+ formatted_class in abo is ttt_issue in ttt
  -> Problems with shared templates (file)

+ Must hack icing (and formatted_classs / ttt_issue) and
  create_or_query_new_tracker_item to work with both templates.
  Probably need to set variables before expanding icing.  Need to factor
  out all stuff that is specific to the individual templates in icing
  (probably only the status line).
